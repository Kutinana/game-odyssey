Hi, welcome to the Game Research Society at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen!

This is the official website of the Game Research Society, aggregating game projects developed by students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

This site aims to provide CUHK‑Shenzhen students with a platform to showcase their game projects and find teams. Here, you can discover various student‑created indie games, get demo builds, or contact the developers. We encourage teams to include contact information and recruitment needs in their project pages so that students interested in game development can proactively reach out.

# I want to submit my game!

We welcome submissions via Pull Request. Please note that we currently accept only indie games developed by CUHK‑Shenzhen students. For team‑developed projects, please first obtain unanimous consent from all team members. For company‑developed projects, please provide additional information so we can determine whether it is suitable to display on this site.

When you wish to submit, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your project folder under `src/projects/` and add `index.md`
3. Add assets such as a `banner` and `screenshots`, and ensure they are properly configured in `index.md`
4. Open a Pull Request, state your name and student ID in the description, and wait for it to be merged

If you are not familiar with this process, you may directly use your university email to send the relevant information about your game to the email address below. We will update it as soon as possible after approval.
