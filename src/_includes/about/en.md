Hi, welcome to the Gaming Odyssey at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen!

This is the official website of the Gaming Odyssey, aggregating game projects developed by students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

This site aims to provide CUHK‑Shenzhen students with a platform to showcase their game projects and find teams. Here, you can discover various student‑created indie games, get demo builds, or contact the developers. We encourage teams to include contact information and recruitment needs in their project pages so that students interested in game development can proactively reach out.

# I want to submit my game!

---

We welcome submissions via Pull Request. Please note that we currently accept only indie games developed by CUHK‑Shenzhen students. For team‑developed projects, please first obtain unanimous consent from all team members. For company‑developed projects, please provide additional information so we can determine whether it is suitable to display on this site.

## Submission steps

When you wish to submit, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your project folder under `src/projects/` and add `index.json`
3. Add assets such as a `banner` and `screenshots`, and ensure they are properly configured in `index.json`
4. Commit your project folder, open a Pull Request, state your name and student ID in the description, and wait for it to be merged

## Project folder structure

A project folder should include at minimum:
- `index.njk`: fixed template; you may copy it from any existing project
- `index.json`: metadata file storing your project's basic information and guiding how the system should read it

After configuring these two files, we recommend adding:
- `banner`: project header image
- `content.md`: to display more than just the title and team name on the detail page, include at least one Markdown file and configure its path correctly in `index.json`
- `screenshots/`: gameplay screenshots

## Other

In principle, as long as things are configured correctly, the system can recognize your resources regardless of naming or paths. However, we still encourage a tidy and standardized folder structure. You can refer to existing projects. If you need help, feel free to contact us via the email below.

Please do not modify other people's projects or submit such changes; otherwise, we will reject the PR. When you need to update your own project's information, it is best to use the same GitHub account as your initial submission. Otherwise, you may be asked to provide proof that you have the right to make changes to the project.

If you are not familiar with the submission process, you may directly use your **university email** to send the relevant information about your game to the email address below. We will update it as soon as possible after approval.

Please ensure that your submission complies with laws, regulations, and relevant policies, and that its content is suitable for public display. The CUHK‑Shenzhen Gaming Odyssey reserves the right to modify or remove any submitted project.
